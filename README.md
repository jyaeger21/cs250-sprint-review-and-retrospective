How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Exceptional understanding and empathy is needed to translate user needs into a program. Technical skills can be wasted if they are not applied with the user or business needs in mind. Creating user stories provides a clear and concise format to payout the user needs and form acceptance criteria and program requirements.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach development with creativity, flexibility, and empathy guiding my problem solving. In future work I would like to incorporate and use many of the agile processes to experience firsthand the strengths/weaknesses of kanban/scrum/lean/xp etc.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

One must be able to cooperate effectively, communicate honestly, enjoy helping others, quite simply being a good person, an empathetic person, will enable great teamwork. Being individually competent is not enough to succeed in an agile environment.
